# Introduction

eSlimKorea is testing Tenstorrent’s NPU using TT-Buda, an AI/ML compiler stack developed by Tenstorrent, to evaluate and optimize AI model performance against traditional GPUs.

Note on terminology:

TT-Buda is the official Tenstorrent AI/ML compiler stack and PyBuda is the Python interface for TT-Buda. PyBuda allows users to access and utilize TT-Buda's features directly from Python. This includes directly importing model architectures and weights from PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, and TFLite.

## Test Models
Model demos are now part of a separate repo: [here](https://github.com/eSlimKorea/TT-BUDA-TEST-Models)


## Docs
For detailed documentation on  TT-Buda refer to the [here](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/pybuda/latest/index.html).

## Build
Instructions for installing and building the TT-Buda stack can be found [here](https://docs.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/v/tt-buda/installation).
